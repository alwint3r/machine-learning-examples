Machine Learning Code Examples
==============================

These codes are written just as an exercise for me. I might use them as *seeds* for future production code, perhaps.



## You might ask

**Where do you learn to write them?**
1. [Python Machine Learning](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-machine-learning) book by Sebastian Raschka
2. [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course from Coursera (on going at the time).

*List will keep going on...*

**What language and libraries or frameworks do you use?**
I am primarily using Python for machine learning. I use scikit-learn, theano, and keras with scipy/numpy and pandas in my arsenal. I plan to learn tensorflow soon.

You might see octave/MATLAB code. I learned to write them from Machine Learning course from Coursera.
